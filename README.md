# LowLevelDesign
This contains how the LowLevel design of the classes can be done and how we can follow best practices as well and some random taughts or experiments from my end

## My love towards OOPS
I personally love LOW-LEVEL-DESIGN as this use to be a day to day activity for any most of the software Engineers this helps me in thinking ðŸ¤” and articulate my ideas by following some of the best practices and to write a clean and good code , I'm always open to suggestions and at the same time very much interested in learning from different experiences, I have personally read some of the amazing books and learnt and have applied the same learning in my career ðŸš—  and have helped my team mates in following some good practices throughout the development. I have shared some of the resources that I have used in my Development phase and have helped me a lot in understanding and giving better exposure to the oops world.


## Resources 
1. Clean code (Robert C.Martin) book I mostly refer this book whenever I get some doubts and use to keep it handy
2. Head First Java , Book has given me a so much of visual representation of the opps world and has made me understand some of the concepts in a very interesting way , it's all about visualisation so that you can keep this learning for long term 
3. SOLID principles [medium blof](https://medium.com/backticks-tildes/the-s-o-l-i-d-principles-in-pictures-b34ce2f1e898) very good visual representation of the modules
4. Design pattern [oops design pattern](https://www.oodesign.com/design-principles.html) ,awww shuch a beautiful way to describe Java design pattern , I love this website and I refer often

>> I mostly use youtube to learn Java's best practices from [Devoxx](https://www.youtube.com/c/Devoxx2015/search?query=java%20best%20practices%20) , I have learnt about clean code and best Utility classes to use to make the best out of it, how they approach problems and how do they simplify the complex things , I love how they classify things easily and I have personally used many of the scenarios from them

!! Periodically I'll be Updating this readme page then and there !!
